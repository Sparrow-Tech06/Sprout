    "Ravi’s life felt exciting when he started his first job. Every month, when his salary arrived, he enjoyed the freedom of making small purchases and treating himself. Ordering food, buying little things online, and going out on weekends slowly became part of his routine.",
    "Ravi never planned ahead. His thinking was simple: whatever remained at the end of the month would be enough. Most of the time, however, there was very little left. He did not worry much, believing that things would somehow work out on their own.",
    "One evening, an unexpected call came from home. There was an urgent situation, and help was needed quickly. Ravi checked his account and felt uneasy. He had some balance, but not enough to feel prepared. For the first time, he realized how unready he was for sudden situations.",
    "That night, Ravi did not make any big promises. He only decided to change one small thing. The next time his salary came in, he quietly set aside a small portion first. The rest of his routine stayed mostly the same, just with a little more awareness.",
    "Over the next few months, Ravi noticed a change. His lifestyle had not changed much, but his confidence had. Knowing that something was kept aside gave him a sense of calm he had never felt before.",
    "Ravi learned that life does not always warn before testing you. Being prepared, even in small ways, can make difficult moments easier to handle."
